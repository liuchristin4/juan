Juan is an intelligent slack bot that welcomes new employees to a company's workspace. It asks the new employee for things they like (ie. pets, boardgames, rock climbing... you name it!) and sends a tailored set of recommendations for existing company channels (groups) so they are quickly introduced to likeminded coworkers :)

































inspo: on the last week of my internship I realized our company had a pets channel-- wish i'd known earlier!
